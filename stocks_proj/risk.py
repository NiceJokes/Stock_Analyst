''' Linear regression model:
    y_i = alpha + beta_xi 
    a linear regression model tells you how x_i and y_i are related, 
    and how values of x_i can be used to predict values of y_i
    
    CAPM:
    R_t - r_{RF} = alpha + beta (R_Mt - r_RF) 
    
    beta = r * {s_y}/{s_x} / r = correlation between stock return and market index
                            s_y/x = standard deviations
    alpha =  y(mean) - beta * x(mean) 

    the risk premium of individual stock depends on two components: 
    market risk and the market risk-premium
    
    alpha - average excess return over the market
    beta - how much a stock moves in relation to the market, the expected market risk-premium increases by
    1%, the individual stock's expected return would increase by Î²% and vice versa
